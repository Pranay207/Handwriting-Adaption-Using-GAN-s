🩺 RxGAN: Prescription Handwriting Normalization

Normalize diverse handwritten styles, such as doctor prescriptions, using GANs to improve OCR recognition accuracy.

📸 Overview

Doctors’ handwriting often varies widely, making prescriptions and notes difficult to read. This project:

Normalizes diverse handwriting styles 🖌️

Improves OCR recognition accuracy 🎯

Provides a simple pipeline for preprocessing handwritten images 🖥️

## ⚙️ How to Use  

1. 📄 Collect handwritten images (doctor prescriptions, forms, etc.)  
2. 🎨 Normalize handwriting styles using the GAN model  
3. 🔹 Apply OCR to extract text from normalized images  
4. 🖥️ (Optional) Run the Streamlit demo for interactive testing  

```bash
# Run the Streamlit demo
streamlit run app.py
